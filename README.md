# Chase-AI

Chase is an abstract strategy game that's played on a hex board with 6-sided dice as game pieces. It shares some similarities with Chess: perfect information, no elements of chance, and pieces that move in designated ways. Many Chess strategies like pins and forks can be used in Chase. <a href="https://nestorgames.com/rulebooks/CHASE_EN.pdf" target="_blank">Read the rules here</a>.

Chase-AI is a way to play Chase on your Windows computer against an AI opponent.
